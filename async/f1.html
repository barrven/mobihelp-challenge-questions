    <h1>Async Practice</h1>
    
    <p>
        Often in Javascript we will make a request for some data to some external URL. We cannot know how long this request will take,
        but want to render results as quickly as possible and in the correct order. This can help make it appear that the interface is 
        running smoothly for the user
    </p>

    <p>
        Your challenge is to complete the renderResponse() function below in such a way that it will print the responses in order as 
        soon as it recieves them. In other words, you can't wait for all the responses to be recieved before you output the result. 
        But if the first response is the second item, you have to wait until you get the first item before you can output it.
    </p>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <div id='output'></div>

<script>

    //this function simluates making some data request that may return asynchronously
    function simDataRequest(url, callback) {
        
        let responses = {
            "url-1": "First Data result",
            "url-2": "Second Data result",
            "url-3": "Third data result"
        };
        
        let randomDelay = (Math.round(Math.random() * 1E4) % 8000) + 1000;

        console.log("Requesting: " + url); //log the request and notice that it appears before the result

        //return requested response after a random delay
        setTimeout(() =>{
            callback(responses[url]);
        }, randomDelay);
    }


    function getResponse(file) {

        simDataRequest(file, text => {
            renderResponse(file, text);
        });
    }

    function renderResponse(file, text) {

        responses[file] = text; // store the response in the responses object

        // loop through the stored responses in order
        for (var i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {

            // check if a given file is in the responses (this controls the order that responses will be printer)
            if (urls[i] in responses) {
                // check if the response has been already rendered
                if (responses[urls[i]] !== true) { //hasn't been rendered yet
                    //document.writeln(`${responses[urls[i]]}<br>`); 
                    document.getElementById('output').innerHTML += `${responses[urls[i]]}<br>`; //render the response to the document
                    responses[urls[i]] = true; //change the reponse value to true once it's been rendered
                }
            }
            else {
                //if the first file is not in responses then we know we don't want to render any responses yet, so just quit the function
                return;
            }
        }

        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML += "Finished rendering";
    }

    //hold urls to request
    let urls = ["url-1", "url-2", "url-3"];
    //object to hold responses
    let responses = {};

    // request all files at once
    getResponse(urls[0]);
    getResponse(urls[1]);
    getResponse(urls[2]);
