    <h1>Async Practice</h1>

    <p>
        Often in Javascript we will make a request for some data to some external URL. We cannot know how long this
        request will take,
        but want to render results as quickly as possible and in the correct order. This can help make it appear that
        the interface is
        running smoothly for the user
    </p>

    <p>
        Your challenge is to complete the renderResponse() function below in such a way that it will print the responses
        in order as
        soon as it recieves them. In other words, you can't wait for all the responses to be recieved before you output
        the result.
        But if the first response is the second item, you have to wait until you get the first item before you can
        output it.
    </p>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <div id='output'></div>

    <script>

        //this function simluates making some data request that may return asynchronously
        function simDataRequest(url, callback) {

            let responses = {
                "url-1": "First Data result",
                "url-2": "Second Data result",
                "url-3": "Third data result"
            };

            let randomDelay = (Math.round(Math.random() * 1E4) % 8000) + 1000;

            console.log("Requesting: " + url); //log the request and notice that it appears before the result

            //return requested response after a random delay
            setTimeout(() => {
                callback(responses[url]);
            }, randomDelay);
        }


        function getResponse(file) {

            simDataRequest(file, text => {
                renderResponse(file, text);
            });
        }

        function renderResponse(file, text) {

            
            //COMPLETE THIS FUNCTION

        }

        //hold urls to request
        let urls = ["url-1", "url-2", "url-3"];
        //object to hold responses
        let responses = {};

        // request all files at once
        getResponse(urls[0]);
        getResponse(urls[1]);
        getResponse(urls[2]);

    </script>
